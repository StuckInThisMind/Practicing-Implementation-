To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `Assignment_5_main.java` file.
4. The program will display the area and perimeter for each shape.

## Shapes

### Circle

The `Circle` class represents a circle shape. It takes the radius as input to calculate the area and perimeter.

### Triangle

The `Triangle` class represents a triangle shape. It takes the lengths of the base and height as input to calculate the area and perimeter.

### Rectangle

The `Rectangle` class represents a rectangle shape. It takes the lengths of the length and breadth as input to calculate the area and perimeter.
